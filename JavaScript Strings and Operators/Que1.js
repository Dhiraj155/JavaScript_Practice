//Javascript Operators
//Javascript Operators Assign two numeric variables a and b Initialise values as 5 and 10 respectively and console log in same order the following:

//Create a variable add and assign it the sum of a and b.
//Create a variable sub and assign it result of b subtracted from a.
//Create a variable mul and assign it the product of a and b.
//Create a variable div and assign it the result of of a divided by b.
//Create a variable inc and assign it the preincremented value of a.
//Create a variable dec and assign it the predecremented value of b.
//Example 1:
//Input:
//var a = 5 var b = 10

//Output:
//15 5 50 0.5 6 9

//Explanation:
//We have operate the given operations in ascending order and printed the result at every instance, Hence, the output.

//Constraints:
//Restrict to the input format that is mentioned. Use whatever you have learned in live class curriculum to solve this challenge.

var a= 5
var b = 10
add = a+b
sub = b-a
mul = a*b
div = a/b
inc = ++a
dec = --b

console.log(add);
console.log(sub);
console.log(mul);
console.log(div);
console.log(inc);
console.log(dec);
