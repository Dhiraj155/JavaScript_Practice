//Printing Even Numbers
//Using a for loop print all even numbers up to and including n and donâ€™t include 0.

//Example 1:
//Input:
//let n = 22;

//Output:
//2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22

//Explanation:
//We have to print all even numbers excluding 0 to the number. Hence, the output where even numbers are printed upto 22 including 22 but excluding 0.

//Constraints:
//Restrict to the input format that is mentioned. Use whatever you have learned in live class curriculum to solve this challenge.
