//Sum of two arrays
//Get the sum of two arraysâ€¦actually the sum of all their elements and print the output. Note: Each array includes only integer numbers.

//Example 1:
//Input:
//let arr_1 = [3, 5, 22, 5, 7, 2, 45, 75, 89, 21, 2]; let arr_2 = [9, 2, 42, 55, 71, 22, 4, 5, 90, 25, 26];

//Output:
//627

//Explanation:
//Individual sum of the elements of individual arrays are 276 and 351 respectively. Hence, the output the sum of these two 627.

//Constraints:
//Restrict to the input format that is mentioned. Use whatever you have learned in live class curriculum to solve this challenge.
