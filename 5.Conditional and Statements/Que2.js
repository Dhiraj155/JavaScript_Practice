//Even or Odd
//Write a JavaScript program that checks if input number is even or odd by using “%” operator in JavaScript.

//Example 1:
//Input:
//var num3 = 17.5 var num4 = 42

//Output:
//17.5 is odd 42 is even

//Explanation:
//Out of the inputed numbers 17.5 and 42 as 17.5 is odd and 42 is even, hence the output.

//Constraints:
//Restict to variables that are given in input format to get your code evaluated.

//ans---

var num3 = 17.5
var num4 = 42
if(num3%2===0){
    console.log(num3+" is even")
}else {
    console.log(num3+" is odd")
}

if(num4%2===0){
    console.log(num4+" is even")
}else {
    console.log(num4+" is odd")
}
